# Open Liberty Tools for VS Code
A VS Code extension for Open Liberty. The extension will detect your Liberty Maven or Liberty Gradle project if it detects the `io.openliberty.tools:liberty-maven-plugin` in the `pom.xml` or `io.openliberty.tools:liberty-gradle-plugin` in the `build.gradle`. Through the Liberty Dev Dashboard, you can start, stop, or interact with Liberty dev mode on all available [Liberty Maven](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/master/docs/dev.md#dev) or [Liberty Gradle](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle/blob/master/docs/libertyDev.md) projects in your workspace.
