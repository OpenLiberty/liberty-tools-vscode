# Change Log

All notable changes to the Liberty Tools extension will be documented below.

## 0.1.12

Version 0.1.12 of Liberty Tools for Visual Studio Code is an **early release** that contains new functionality and fixes. Liberty Tools for Visual Studio Code now requires Java 17 and depends on the [XML by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-xml) and [Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug) Visual Studio Code extensions.

Notable enhancements:
- Editing assistance (completion, hover, diagnostics and quick-fixes) when editing server.xml, server.env, and bootstrap.properties files via the [Liberty Config Language Server](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-language-server).
- Editing assistance (code snippets, diagnostics and quick-fixes) for Jakarta EE 9.x Web Profile APIs when editing Java files via the [Eclipse LSP4Jakarta](https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4jakarta), Language Server for Jakarta EE.
- Liberty projects are now automatically detected via the presence of a “src/main/liberty/config/server.xml” file.
- New “Liberty: Attach Debugger” Liberty action, accessible through the Liberty Dashboard or Visual Studio Code Command Palette. Requires “Liberty: Start” to have been run first.
- Ability to run Liberty actions through the Visual Studio Code Command Palette or the keyboard shortcut: Shift + Alt + L.
- “Liberty: Start…” saves command history.
- Ability to manually add projects to the Liberty Dashboard.
- New icons for Maven and Gradle projects in the Liberty Dashboard.
