## Before you begin

### Software requirements
<!-- Match the VSCode and Java version with the README.md -->
- **Visual Studio Code 1.78.0** or later.
- **Java 17** or later is required by Liberty Tools for Visual Studio Code. To point Visual Studio Code to a specific runtime, see [Settings](#settings) for more information.

### Application requirements

- Define a Liberty `server.xml` configuration file in the `src/main/liberty/config` location.
- [Configure the Liberty Maven Plugin](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven#configuration) or [configure the Liberty Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle#adding-the-plugin-to-the-build-script). We recommend using the most recent versions of the plugins as they include several important bug fixes.

    - [Liberty Maven Plugin latest release](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/releases/latest)

    - [Liberty Gradle Plugin latest release](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle/releases/latest)

### Configure your Java runtime for language servers

Liberty Tools for Visual Studio Code requires Java 17 or later to ensure that the following language servers start properly:
- [Liberty Config Language Server](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/liberty-language-server)
- [Eclipse Language Server for Jakarta EE](https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4jakarta)
- [XML Language Server (LemMinX)](https://github.com/eclipse/lemminx) 

A toast message alerts you if any language server fails to run or if Visual Studio Code has trouble locating your Java.

<img src="/docs/screenshots/update%20jdk%20toast.png" width="40%"/> 
<img src="/docs/screenshots/java_17_toast_alert.png" width="40%" />

To resolve this issue, you can define settings in your Visual Studio Code [settings.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settingsjson) file or set system environment variables to point Liberty Tools to Java 17 or later. 

For both Liberty Config Language Server and Eclipse Language Server for Jakarta EE, Liberty Tools for Visual Studio Code will check for the Java versions in the following order:
1. `java.jdt.ls.java.home` in settings.json
2. The [embedded JRE](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java#java-tooling-jdk) included by [Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java). 
3. `JDK_HOME` or `JAVA_HOME` as system environment variables. (Note: if both `JDK_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` are set, `JDK_HOME` will take precedence)

By default, Liberty Tools installs the latest version of the Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat extension. The latest version contains an embedded JRE higher than Java 17 and therefore no additional configuration is required. However, if using an older version of the Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat extension or using the universal version without the embedded JRE causes an issue, then `java.jdt.ls.java.home` or one of JDK_HOME or JAVA_HOME must be configured to use Java 17 or later.

For LemMinX, Liberty Tools for Visual Studio Code will check for the Java versions in the following order:
1. `xml.java.home` in settings.json
2. `JDK_HOME` or `JAVA_HOME` as system environment variables. (Note: if both `JDK_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` are set, `JDK_HOME` takes precedence)

![settings.json example](/docs/screenshots/settings.json%20path%20example.png)

### External extension settings

| Setting | Description | Provided By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `maven.executable.path` | Maven commands executed by dev mode honour this setting. When this value is empty, dev mode tries to use `mvn` or `mvnw` according to the value of `maven.executable.preferMavenWrapper`. | [Maven for Java extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-maven) |
| `maven.executable.preferMavenWrapper` | Maven commands executed by dev mode honour this setting. If this setting set to `true`, dev mode tries to use `mvnw` if a Maven wrapper file can be found. Otherwise, it uses `mvn`. | [Maven for Java extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-maven) |
| `java.import.gradle.wrapper.enabled` | Gradle commands executed by dev mode honour this setting. If this setting is set to `true`, dev mode tries to use `gradlew` if a Gradle wrapper file can be found. Otherwise, it uses `gradle`. | [Language support for Java extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) |
| `xml.java.home` | This setting allows a user to define their LemMinX language server runtime without altering the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.  | Not set |
| `java.jdt.ls.java.home` | This setting specifies the folder path to the JDK (17 or later) that is used to launch the Java Language Server. This setting replaces the Java extension's embedded JRE to start the language servers.  | Not set |

## Open the Liberty dashboard

By default, the Liberty dashboard appears in the Project Explorer side bar. Optionally, you can drag the Liberty dashboard into the Activity Bar.

| Side Bar view | Activity Bar view |
| ------ | ----- |
| ![Liberty Dashboard Side Bar view](/docs/user-guide-screenshots/liberty_dashboard_side_bar.png) | ![Liberty Dashboard Activity Bar view](/docs/user-guide-screenshots/liberty_dashboard_activity_bar.png)|

Projects that are already properly configured to run on Liberty and use Liberty dev mode are automatically added the Liberty dashboard when it opens. If your Liberty project does not show up in the Liberty dashboard automatically and you have the Liberty Maven or Liberty Gradle plugin configured, check out [how to manually add your project to the Liberty dashboard](#manually-add-your-liberty-project-to-the-dashboard).

If you add new projects or make changes, use the refresh icon in the Liberty dashboard toolbar to refresh the dashboard view.

![Dashboard Refresh highlighted](/docs/user-guide-screenshots/dashboardToolbarRefresh.png)

## Run your application on Liberty using dev mode

The following three menu actions are available to start your Liberty application in dev mode through the Liberty dashboard or the Visual Studio Code command palette:

- [Start your application in dev mode](#start-your-application-in-dev-mode)
- [Start your application in dev mode with configuration](#start-your-application-in-dev-mode-with-configuration)
- [Start your application in dev mode in a container](#start-your-application-in-dev-mode-in-a-container)

### Use the Liberty dashboard

The Liberty dashboard provides a context menu for Liberty projects. You can choose different commands from the menu to speed up application development.
